	    		<p class="card-text">Fast & Furious is a piece of junk, but at least it is an entertaining and endearing piece of junk. For a franchise I actively dislike, this is the best of the bunch. There are only a couple of things to be said about this movie: the cars are fast, the racing is faster and none of it makes the slightest bit of sense.</p>

	    		<p class="card-text">Rowan Atkinson has created one of the most original characters in modern times. Ever since the invention of talkies, there have been few iconic silent characters. We had Harpo Marx, but he came with his brothers. This is truly a unique creation.The best thing is that he is not a nice guy. His selfishness is half the fun. His childlike persona contrasts perfectly with his selfish actions.</p>

	    		<p class="card-text">You won't die laughing in the theater, but the filmmakers aren't asking you to, as they do in the frantic, adolescent comedies that dominate the market. It's a pleasure. While it lives up to the very definition of 'hit and miss', the parts that hit are very funny.</p>

	    		<p class="card-text">Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart give Central Intelligence all the charisma they can, and through their combined sheer force of will, this comedy works. The artist formerly known as The Rock has long since proven that he has more natural acting chops than any other former muscleman-turned-thespian (sorry, Arnie), and he's absolutely riotous here.</p>

	        Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), a villain intent on stealing Britain's Crown Jewels, has murdered the country's top undercover agents, and mediocre spy Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is ordered to prevent further mayhem. But even with help from quick-thinking sidekick Bough (Ben Miller), the goofy agent lands himself in one precarious situation after another. Only when he meets up with Interpol crime-fighter Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia) is Johnny able to chip away at Pascal's defenses.

	        James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.

	        In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.
